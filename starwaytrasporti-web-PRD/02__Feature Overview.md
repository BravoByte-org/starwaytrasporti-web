# Solution/Feature Overview (MVP)

## Multi-level Parallax
The homepage features an eye-catching multi-depth/level parallax with the company's name in strong bold letters. 

## Sticky navigation
The navigation features a sleek responsive design that collapses into a hamburger menu as the window gets smaller. 

## Internationlization
The app automatically translates into the locale of the client. 

## Animations
Each page/route of the app should has applicable animations on both text and media. Fade and fly-in.

## CMS
The CMS is tailored to meet the needs of the maintenance and updates for the app's content. The client, whose primary language is Italian, is able to access the CMS through a `www.starwaytrasporti.com/dashboard` page and navigate easily via the Sanity CMS. 

The developer, whose primary language is English, is able to access the CMS already translated in English in order to provide reasonable backend maintenance. 

## Timeline
A nice-to-have would be an animated timeline slider with a small animated transport truck that visitors can drag through specific times in the company's history. 

Upon landing on each time, either a text toast will appear, giving visitors more context on that time period, like a museum, or an image, for example an image of the old logo or company name on a truck.
