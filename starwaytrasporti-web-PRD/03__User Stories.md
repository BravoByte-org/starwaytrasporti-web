## CMS

### Content Editor
As a content editor I want to log-in to the CMS and in my local language, see a clear navigation, sections, pages, and user-friendly UI for forms, input and media management so that I can easily create pages, customize the page urls, add and update features, content, media, sections and forms. 

As a content editor I can also stage changes and schedule a time to publish content on production. 

## Web app frontend

### Visitor -- potential client
As a visitor to https://www.starwaytrasporti.com I am a product owner that would like to use a transportation company in Italy to deliver my product to my customers reliably. I'm visiting the website to get more information about this company and understand if this transportation company can fulfill this need for my business reliably. I'd like to see that:
1. They have a consistent theme for their brand
2. They have statistics and testimonials to back up their claims and build trust
3. The information on the site is well organized so that I can find answers to any questions I may have
4. An easy way to reach out and schedule a call or visit to discuss a potential relationship/agreement

I want to see an accessible navigation that works both on desktop and mobile when I need to access this information on the go or while I'm not physically at my computer.

I want to see a clear section organization with links to other pages that are related to the particular section that I'm viewing. 

I want to have the standard website experience where I am prompted for my cookie preference as there will be ads and I want to make sure I understand how my data is handled.

I want a standard footer with links to the about page and privacy policy. 

### Visitor -- current client
As a current client, when I visit https://www.starwaytrasporti.com, I would like to be able to quickly access the information I need such as:
1. The warehouse locations (a map would be helpful as well as a collapsable list of locations depending on region/country)
2. A way to get in contact with the business
3. An easily navigable mobile UI
